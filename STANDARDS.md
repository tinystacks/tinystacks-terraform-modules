# Standards to which TF modules should be written
1. All resource names need to be parameterized using the StackName. Every launch via tinystacks takes place within the context of a `STACK_NAME` env var. We should embed this env var into any statically named resources - including defaults set in variables files. Each variables.tf file should include a `STACK_NAME` variable
1. For any modules using a regional cloud provider, the region should not be explicitly set in the module. Rather, it will be set at the terraform provider config level by the process deploying the terraform
    1. For AWS, the env var is named AWS_REGION. use the aws data provider to pull the current region `data "aws_region" "current" {}`
1. For region specific modules (for example VPCs), we should try hard to make the top-level resource names the only necessary variables from a customer perspective. For example, for a new VPC, customers should only have to specify a region and the AZs etc should be taken care of behind the scenes.
